# Mobile Robot Development using ROS

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my work and learning from the 5-day Skill Development Program (SDP) on **Mobile Robot Development using ROS Platform**.

The program covered Python basics, ROS1 fundamentals, simulation in Gazebo, SLAM mapping, navigation, and introduction to ROS2.
